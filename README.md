# *Stanley's Cup!*
![Alt text](Art/unity.png)
*Stanley's Cup!* is a simple 2D platform game intended for mobile devices. The player controls the main character through swipe and tap gestures that cause Stanley to walk or jump. The goal of the player is to ensure Stanley remains within the boundaries of the rink while collecting pucks by hopping between moving hockey stick platforms and avoiding challenges.

The game begins with an interactive tutorial that allows players to cycle through small text tutorials and practice essential game mechanics. When the player is ready, they may tap the *PLAY!* button and proceed to either the first level or the last level played. Levels have fun names that reflect features like:
* The movement of the hockey stick platforms.
* The location and distribution of the puck collectables.
* The type of challenges included in the level.

For example, here are some level names:
* Frozen Beginnings
* Puck Perch
* Dump n' Chase
* Black Out
* Ice Storm
* Bad Frosty
* Overtime

The levels are sequenced in order of difficulty and the player advances to the next level when they collect sufficient pucks to satisfy the target high score. At the beginning of each level the player has a number of "lives" available as indicated by a number of mini-Stanley icons in the left bottom corner of the game. The player sacrifices a life when Stanley leaves the boundaries of the rink or encounters a specific game challenge like being hit by a falling icicle or landing on a platform occupied by an enemy. When all lives are exhausted, the current level restarts with a score of 0.

The game has a *Win!* state that is entered when the player succeeds in advancing through all the levels.
